Question 1.
Create a Human class with two properties: name of type String, and age of type Int. You'll need to 
create a memberwise initializer for the class. Initialize two Human instances.

Make the Human class adopt the CustomStringConvertible. Print both of your previously initialized
Human objects.

Make the Human class adopt the Equatable protocol. Two instances of Human should be considered equal
if their names and ages are identical to one another. Print the result of a boolean expression 
evaluating whether or not your two previously initialized Human objects are equal to eachother
(using ==). Then print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether or not your two
previously initialized Human objects are not equal to eachother (using !=).

Make the Human class adopt the Comparable protocol. Sorting should be based on age. Create another
three instances of a Human, then create an array called people of type [Human] with all of the
Human objects that you have initialized. Create a new array called sortedPeople of type [Human] 
that is the people array sorted by age.
</pre> 

```swift
class Human: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable, Comparable {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    
    var description: String {
        return "This person's name is \(name) and their age is \(age)"
    }

    init(name: String, age: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    }
    
    static func == (lhs: Human, rhs: Human) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.age == rhs.age
    }
    static func < (lhs: Human, rhs: Human) -> Bool {
        return lhs.age < rhs.age
    }
    
}

let person1 = Human(name: "John", age: 27)
let person2 = Human(name: "Jane", age: 25)

print(person1)
print(person2)

if person1 == person2 {
    print("Same person")
} else {
    print("different individuals")
}

if person1 != person2 {
    print("different individuals")
} else {
    print("Same person")

}

let person3 = Human(name: "Mark", age: 19)
let person4 = Human(name: "Mary", age: 16)
let person5 = Human(name: "Luis", age: 30)
let people: [Human] = [person1, person2, person3, person4, person5]
let sortedPeople = people.sorted {$0 < $1}
print(sortedPeople)

```

Question 2. 
Create a protocol called Vehicle with two requirements: a nonsettable numberOfWheels property of
type Int, and a function called drive().

Define a Car struct that implements the Vehicle protocol. numberOfWheels should return a value of 4,
and drive() should print "Vroom, vroom!" Create an instance of Car, print its number of wheels, 
then call drive().

Define a Bike struct that implements the Vehicle protocol. numberOfWheels should return a value of 2,
and drive() should print "Begin pedaling!". Create an instance of Bike, print its number of wheels,
then call drive().
</pre>  

```swift
protocol Vehicle {
    var numberOfWheels: Int {get}
    
    func drive()
}

struct Car: Vehicle {
    var numberOfWheels: Int = 4
    
    func drive() {
        print("Vroom, vroom!")
    }
    
    
}

let Ford = Car()
print(Ford.numberOfWheels)
Ford.drive()

struct Bike: Vehicle {
    var numberOfWheels: Int = 2
    
    func drive() {
        print("Begin pedaling!")
    }
    
    
}

let mountainBike = Bike()
print(mountainBike.numberOfWheels)
mountainBike.drive()
```

Question 3. 
// Given the below two protocols, create a struct for penguin(a flightless bird) and an eagle.
Give your structs some properties and have them conform to the appropriate protocols.

protocol Bird {
 var name: String { get }
 var canFly: Bool { get }
}

protocol Flyable {
 var airspeedVelocity: Double { get }
}
</pre> 
```swift
protocol Bird {
    var name: String { get }
    var canFly: Bool { get }
}

protocol Flyable {
    var airspeedVelocity: Double { get }
}

struct Penguin: Bird {
    var name: String = "Penguin"
    var canFly: Bool = false
}
struct Eagle: Bird, Flyable {
    var name: String = "Eagle"
    var canFly: Bool = true
    var airspeedVelocity: Double = 80
}
```

</br> </br> 

<pre>
Question 4. 
// Create a protocol called Transformation

// create a mutating method called transform

// Make an enum called SuperHero (have it conform to Transformation) and an instance of it named
bruceBanner. Make it so that when the transform function is called that bruceBanner turns from 
.notHulk to .hulk.

enum SuperHero: Transformation {
    // write code here.
}

Example Output: 
var bruceBanner = SuperHero.notHulk

bruceBanner.transform() . // hulk

bruceBanner.transform()  // notHulk
</pre> 

```swift
protocol Transformation {
    mutating func transform()
}

enum SuperHero: Transformation {
    
    case Hulk
    case notHulk
    
    mutating func transform() {
        switch self {
        case .Hulk:
            self = .notHulk
        case .notHulk:
            self = .Hulk
        }
    }    
}

var bruceBanner = SuperHero.notHulk
bruceBanner.transform()
print(bruceBanner)
bruceBanner.transform()
print(bruceBanner)
```

</br> </br> 

<pre>
Question 5. 
// 1. Create a protocol called Communication

// 2. Give it a property called talk, of type String, and assign it an explicit getter.

// 3. Create three Classes. Cow, Dog, Cat.

// 4. Have your three classes conform to Communication

// 5. talk should return a unique message for each animal when talk is called.

// 6. Put an instance of each of your Classes in an array.

// 7. Iterate over the array and have them print talk.
</pre> 

```swift
protocol Communication {
    var talk: String {get}
}
class Cow: Communication {
    var talk: String = "Moo"
}
class Dog: Communication {
    var talk: String = "Woof"
}
class Cat: Communication {
    var talk: String = "Meow"
}
let cow = Cow()
let dog = Dog()
let cat = Cat()
let animalsArray: [Communication] = [cow,dog,cat]
for animals in animalsArray {
    print(animals.talk)
}
```
